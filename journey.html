												  <h3>RIT Simone Center</h3>
												  <h5>Innovation Fellows Program</h5>
												  <h6>Tools: Google Suite (Docs, Sheets, Slides)</h6>
												  <p>
													As the world shut down and many students lost their co-ops, RIT created the Innovation Fellows Program in collaboration with local Rochester companies. This would count for co-op credit, keeping students on track for graduation, while providing valuable experiences for the student and employers. The team I was on worked on <a href="https://www.mindex.com/schooltool" target="_blank">Mindex's SchoolTool</a>, a K-12 Student Management System based in New York State. I was responsible for conducting customer discovery interviews with various teachers, parents, and school faculty to determine if we can use data to predict possible dropouts or other threats so that we can provide adequate support to students. This taught me how to gather valuable customer insights to extract requirements for products. I was also able to sharpen my business skills as we executed market research, our value proposition, a competitive matrix, a 5-year financial plans, as well as numerous investor pitch presentations.

											  <h3>Enel X</h3>
											  <h5>QA Software Engineering Intern</h5>
											  <h6>Tools: Postman, Jira, Javascript, Cucumber</h6>
											  <p>
												My first external co-op was at Enel X as a Quality Assurance Software Engineering intern. Trying to navigate the new remote world, I was responsible for exploratory testing, quality assurance reviews, and acceptance testing to uncover and document software bugs. This was an eye opening experience as it was my first real world experience in the world of Software Engineering. I learned a lot about testing features, ensuring quality, accessibility, finding bugs, RESTful APIs, agile development, and much more. Throughout my time at Enel X, I was able to create a Postman automated testing suite with full API converage for all of our supported services.

											  <h3>SAS Institute Inc</h3>
											  <h5>Fraud Product Management Intern</h5>
											  <h6>Tools: Jira, MS Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), SAS</h6>
											  <p>
												At SAS, I was assigned to their <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/anti-money-laundering.html" target="_blank">Anti-Money Laundering</a> product. SAS leverages AI and machine learning to help institutions comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations. As a Product Management Intern, I was responsible for researching ways to improve our product and create features based on customer insights. One angle I looked at was how we can improve user engagement through gamification utilizing techniques such as the <a href="https://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/" target="_blank">Octalysis Gamifaction Framework</a> to motivate our customers. Another project I worked on was creating a decision support visualization feature. This feature was aimed at geographically mapping suspicious cash flow transactions. An example of this is if someone has various cash deposits at different bank branches. If these cash deposits are under the reporting limit of $10,000, it may not trigger existing alerts. If we were able to map these transactions, we could see patterns such as bank branches that are along Interstate 95, giving investigators crucial information while they work through their money laundering cases. I was able to interview subject matter experts and customers to determine the best ways to implement this feature. Lastly, I was able to earn my <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/ae625c1b-3e22-40e8-b67e-18a4f06234a1/public_url" target="_blank">Base Programming Specialist certification</a> in SAS 9.4!
